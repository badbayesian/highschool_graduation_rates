To run locally, you only need to change the repo location on line 154 (in code section). Make sure that the work directory is pointing to the correct location (getwd() to check, setwd() to set). The script uses three common packages in R: 'tidyverse' - data manipulation, 'tigris' - State FIP data, and 'geofacet' - spatial plotting. The script should automatically install the latest version of each package. The script assumes you are using the latest version of R 3.4.2. Your milage may vary on older versions. If you want to assume that this will run on most computers, I can dockerize the script for future references.

code.R uses the data from IPUMS (highschool_grad_rate.csv) and creates the 50+1 US state plots (Ex: state_plots/AL.png) as well as a national plot (national_plot/national_plot.png) to show represent the data with some geospatial coordination. Similarly, code.R produces first difference plots by state (Ex: diff_state_plots/AL.png) and nationally (diff_national_plot/diff_national_plot.png).

In total, this zip file contains: the four folders of plots for 104 total plots, the data from IPUMS, the R file, the RData file, and the pdf report. Additional files such as the .tex file or racial graduation gap plots per state and nationally can also be requested.
